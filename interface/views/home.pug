                        p.content AI systems and products are becoming more and more ubiquitous thanks to advances in machine learning and big data. Obtaining the right data can often be the most challenging obstacle in creating a new AI system for analyzing the sounds in a home environment.
                        p.content Polyphonic, a research project from Carnegie Mellon’s Human-Computer Interaction Institute. We are taking a game with a purpose (GWAP) approach to solve this problem by collecting audio data that generates an annotated public audio database. This will help students and researchers in training the AI, thus advancing sound research and development. 
                        p.content We are using the Twitch platform to collect sounds in homes including but not limited to dishwasher running, coughing, footsteps and security alarm.The key point from our client was to focus on quantity over quality. They required an audio collection experience to collect large amounts of annotated audio data related to sounds at home.

                            p.intro Polyphonic is a research project from Carnegie Mellon’s Human-Computer Interaction Institute. The goal of this project is to compile a dataset of audio clips that would allow our partners to advance their research into in-home technologies. Through the use of an Audio Game With a Purpose (GWAP) we are able to incentivize the collection of these sounds, categorize, and verify them before adding them to a collective database available to researchers.

                            p.intro Our mobile application and streamer’s website help leverage gamification in the process of collecting quality audio data sets. The website helps streamers publish events which can be joined by viewers on our mobile app to collect associated sounds and validate them. The validated sound clips are then used as game collectables for our fun filled Rolling Rhapsody Game played by streamers on Twitch.
